# DAY-3-Challenge-Student-Performance-Analyzer-
Features:

The program takes N student names and marks as input.
The system uses lists to keep student information.
The system divides marks into these assessment groups:
Excellent for marks between 90 and 100
Very Good for marks between 75 and 89
Good for marks between 60 and 74
Average for marks between 40 and 59
Fail for marks between 0 and 39
Invalid for marks less than 0 or greater than 100
The system calculates the complete number of valid students. The system calculates the complete number of students who failed. The system presents an entire summary at the conclusion of the process.

Personalization Logic

The program includes a personalized condition.
The system checks the length of each student’s name.
If the name length is even, 5 marks are added to the student’s score with a maximum limit of 100.
The marks stay the same when the name length is odd.
